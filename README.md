# Diabetes Prediction Project README

## Introduction:

Diabetes is a chronic medical condition that affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection and accurate prediction of diabetes can lead to timely intervention and better management of the disease. Thanks to advancements in technology, we can leverage data analysis and machine learning techniques to build predictive models for diabetes diagnosis.

This project aims to develop a diabetes prediction system using machine learning algorithms. We will use a dataset containing various medical predictor variables to predict whether a patient has diabetes or not. The dataset is sourced from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases and includes features such as the number of pregnancies, BMI, insulin levels, age, and more.

## General Background:

### Objective:
The main objective of this project is to predict the occurrence of diabetes based on the characteristics of individuals.

### Dataset:
The dataset consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable (outcome). The target variable represents whether the patient has diabetes (1) or not (0). The dataset has been preprocessed and filtered to include only female patients of at least 21 years of age from the Pima Indian origin.

## Project Implementation:

### Part 1: Data Preparation and Regression Models

1. Data Preparation:
   - Explore the dataset and analyze its structure.
   - Handle any missing data or outliers if present.
   - Perform data cleaning and preprocessing.

2. Train-Test Split:
   - Split the dataset into a training set (X_train, y_train) and a test set (X_test, y_test).

3. Regression Models:
   - Utilize various regression techniques to predict diabetes occurrence, such as:
     - Logistic Regression
     - Ridge Regression
     - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
     - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
     - Any other supervised approaches available in scikit-learn.

4. Model Evaluation:
   - Use cross-validation to assess the performance of each model.
   - Compare the results using performance measures like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

### Part 2: Deep Learning Model using Keras

1. Data Preprocessing for Deep Learning:
   - Ensure the dataset contains only numeric variables suitable for neural networks.

2. Building the Deep Learning Model:
   - Use Keras to define the architecture of the deep learning model.
   - Experiment with different layers, neurons, and activation functions.
   - Incorporate a dropout layer to prevent overfitting.

3. Model Training and Evaluation:
   - Train the deep learning model on the preprocessed data.
   - Evaluate the model's performance using relevant metrics.
   - Tune hyperparameters for optimal results.

### Part 3: Graphics and Ergonomics

1. Exporting the Best Model:
   - Save the best performing model for future use.

2. Building a GUI:
   - Create a graphical user interface (GUI) for the diabetes prediction system.
   - Use PyQt, a Python module that links with the Qt library, for creating graphical interfaces.

## Getting Started:

To run the diabetes prediction system, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Install the required dependencies by setting up a virtual environment.
3. Preprocess the dataset to handle missing values and scale features if needed.
4. Run the data splitting and regression model scripts to evaluate various algorithms.
5. Build and train the deep learning model using Keras.
6. Export the best model and integrate it with the GUI using PyQt.

## Conclusion:

This diabetes prediction project demonstrates the application of machine learning and deep learning techniques to predict the occurrence of diabetes based on patient characteristics. By utilizing the power of data analysis and AI, we aim to contribute to early detection and better management of diabetes, ultimately improving the lives of patients affected by this condition.
